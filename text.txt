In 2020, the year of being home all the time, I realized I had forgotten about fun. Not just because there is less fun to be had now that many shops, restaurants, clubs, cinemas, and borders are closed. But because the pressure and pace of time-as-usual supported my distraction from the fact of it: it was a future-driven life. And since I got a driver's license (at age 16, in Arkansas) or any sense of possibility to leave where I was from, I formed the habit of running and abstracting where I was going.
