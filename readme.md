This website will be a landing page for a set of blogs I will keep simultaneously (for now). 

The overarching concept is an art project centered around the idea of re-learning how to engage with curiosity, friviolity, and joy as the main aspects of making things - to feel free to create with spontanaiety and abandon, or even no aim at all. 

The first blog, [Film Fog](https://github.com/moa-mnsr/filmfog) will be about films/novels I've seen/read recently - a sort of running journal of what strikes me as exciting at the moent. 

The second, [Simply Sims](https://github.com/moa-mnsr/simply-sims), will be about playing the original Sims, as an adult, in the pandemic.
